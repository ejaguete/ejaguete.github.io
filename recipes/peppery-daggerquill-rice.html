                        <h1>to make the rice & chicken</h1>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Let’s set the stock to boil! Blanch the chicken bones with
                                some hot water, then set it to boil with the mashed ginger.</li>
                            <li>Meanwhile, slice the shallots. Put them on a paper towel so
                                that the juices soak out of the shallots.</li>
                            <li>Heat the cooking oil in a pan, and throw in the shallots. Make
                                sure all the shallots are covered by the oil, and turn the heat
                                down to low.</li>
                            <li>The moment the shallots turn brown, turn off the heat and let
                                it sit for a minute. This ensures that the shallots will not burn.</li>
                            <li>Separate the shallots from the shallot oil. Do not throw away
                                either. We will only use the shallot oil, but the fried shallots
                                are good as an additional garnish. Some chicken rice stalls
                                will boil up some baby bok choy/xiao bai cai, and top it with
                                oyster sauce to serve with this as a side dish.</li>
                            <li>Put the uncooked rice in your pot, and instead of water, use
                                the chicken stock that you have made to fill the pot to a
                                height of around the first joint of your index finger, around 1.9
                                cups (450mL).</li>
                            <li>Next, twist the lemongrass till it breaks, tie the pandan into a
                                knot, and put both in the pot, along with the sliced ginger and
                                5 tbsp (75mL) of the shallot oil. You will have to remove the
                                lemongrass and pandan after the rice cooks.
                                8. Alright, it’s time for the chicken (with skin on)! Season</li>
                            <li>Alright, it’s time for the chicken (with skin on)! Season the
                                stock with salt and WHITE pepper and then ease the chicken
                                in. Cook on low heat for 30 mins.</li>
                            <li>After the chicken is cooked, dunk it into the ice water for 10
                                mins. This is a way to ensure the outside skin is still soft, while
                                the latent heat in the chicken cooks the rest of it.</li>
                            <li>Take the chicken out and massage it with sesame oil!</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h1>TO MAKE CONDIMENTS/GARNISH</h1>
                        <ol start="11">
                            <li>Ah, the bane of my life. I thought to remove the seeds before
                                blending the chili peppers, but maced myself terribly. Wear
                                gloves, or just blend the whole chillies.</li>
                            <li>Add some salt and sugar to taste to the blended chili peppers.</li>
                            <li>Render the chicken fat until you get some chicken oil.
                                (Basically, just add a little water to the chicken fats in a pan,
                                and cook until the fats and skin get crispy. The rest of the stuff
                                in the pan will be chicken oil.)</li>
                            <li>Heat up the chicken oil until it sizzles, and pour it into the
                                blended chili peppers and mix well! This is the chili sauce.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <div class="note">The following condiments are not shown in the picture, but
                        you might want to make the ‘holy trinity’ of ginger/soy sauce, dark
                        soy sauce, and chili sauce from above for the full chicken rice
                        experience!</div>
                        <ol start="15">
                            <li>(Optional) Mix the minced ginger with the regular soy sauce
                                and a splash of sesame oil.</li>
                            <li>(Optional) Get the right type of dark soy sauce. Must be thick!
                                (A recommended soy sauce is the Lee Kum Kee Premium
                                Dark Soy Sauce. You might be able to buy it <a href="https://
                                smile.amazon.com/dp/B0001EJ4CU/">here</a>.)</li>
                            <li>(Optional) You can also take some of the stock to drink with
                                your meal! Chicken rice stalls will also give it to you
                                sometimes.</li>
                            <li>Now for the plating! I cheated and used just the breast to
                                plate mine so it would look neater, but we attacked the rest of
                                the chicken indiscriminately later. Cut the chicken as neatly as
                                you can, basically.</li>
                            <li>Pile some rice on a plate, press the cut chicken onto it, put the
                                cucumber slices at the side, draw a circle with the chili sauce
                                around it, and top with a sprig of coriander.</li>
                            <li>Enjoy your hard work and decide to never do it again and just
                                go and eat from the masters next time.</li>
